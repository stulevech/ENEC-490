Here lies a series of exercises I completed for ENEC 490: Energy Modeling and Analytics at UNC-Chapel Hill in Fall 2017. 

This series of exercises was my first exposure to programming, and I'm very confident the code I've written here will not only be confusing, but also verbose! That being said, power systems modeling is personally super interesting to me. It's no doubt important to you as well, as you are a human and I presume are concerned about climate change. Understanding the short- and long-term patterns of our electricity system is a first step in transitioning efficiently to a grid powered by renewable energy resources. 

The class also emphasized some intermediate-level predictive modeling topics, as would be expected for an analytics class.

These included: 

1.Forecasting peak demand using historical data (intro to CV)
2.Predicting natural gas price shocks and market failures using basic markov models
3.Ensemble forecasting of Henry Hub natural gas prices
4.Multiple regression of Henry Hub natural gas prices
5.Time series modeling of intermittent wind and solar resources
6.Sensitivity analyses pertaining to historical weather and climate data
7.Exercises in Generation Expansion, Demand-Response, Distributed Generation, and a lot of practice with data cleaning!
